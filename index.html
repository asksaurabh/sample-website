    <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
    <p>
      The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an
      <em>American media</em> franchise and shared universe centered on a series
      of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on
      characters that appear in American comic books published by
      <strong> Marvel Comics </strong>. The franchise also includes television
      series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe,
      much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by
      crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

      In 2007, at 33 years old, Feige was named studio chief. In order to
      preserve its artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative
      committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore: Feige, Marvel
      Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Comics' president of
      publishing Dan Buckley, Marvel's chief creative officer Joe Quesada,
      writer Brian Michael Bendis, and Marvel Entertainment president Alan Fine,
      who oversaw the committee.
