    <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
    <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an
        <em>American media</em> franchise and shared universe centered on a series
        of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on
        characters that appear in American comic books published by
        <strong> Marvel Comics </strong>. The franchise also includes television
        series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe,
        much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by
        crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.
